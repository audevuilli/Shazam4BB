## Assembly Instructions

There are mutliple possibilities to build and configure Shazam4BB. For example, you could chose between an off-the-shelf and customed 3D printed enclosure, power it using a plug or a solar panel, or record soundscape with an ultrasonic (for bats) or a simple audible microphone (for birds). 

Below, we provide the assembly instructions to build Shazam4BB using an off-the-shelf enclosure, powering using a plug, and recording with an ultrasonic microphone. If you would like to develop your own setup and share it with use, let us know.
