Shazam for Bats &amp; Birds - A realtime acoustic birds and bats classification systems built on the TFLite version of BirdNet. 

### Vision Statement
Shazam4BB (Shazam for Bats & Birds) is aimed at ecologists and nature-lover communities. This project facilitates the adoption of technology to monitor the calls of birds and bats and learn about the different species populated a local area. It provides easy-to-follow documentation to build and install the device as well as to visualise in real-time bats and birds calls. This project hopes to gain better understanding of how birds and bats species are distributed and adapted to various environment.

### Minimal Viable Project
1. Process: Audio recording. Microphone. Microcontroller device with Audio Input
2. Analysis: Audio analysis. DL Algorithm to identify species in spectrogram.
3. Visualisation: Audio resutls. Save result in database. 

Shazam4BB is a on-going project. It evolves along the [**Open Hardware Makers (OHM)**](https://curriculum.openhardware.space/) programme. The aim of this project is to improve the technical capability of the 4 years old ["Shazam for Bats"](https://connected-environments.org/portfolio/shazamforbats/) project.

#### Team
The team behind this project is composed of PhD Students, Professors, and Practitioners in the field of ecology and engineering based at the [Connected Environments Lab](https://connected-environments.org/) at The Bartlett CASA, at the [People and Nature Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee/people-and-nature-lab/) at the Centre for Biodvierstiy and Environment Research CBER at UCL. 

#### Specific Goals
There are similar open-hardware projects outhere that monitor and classify birds or bats in real-time. The project is specific for the following reasons:
- Classify bats & birds on the same device. 
- Optimise for long-range transmission and low-power consumption.
