# Shazam4BB

Shazam for Bats &amp; Birds - A realtime acoustic birds and bats classification systems running on a RaspberryPi device.  

### Vision Statement
Shazam4BB (Shazam for Bats & Birds) is aimed at ecologists and nature-lover communities. This project facilitates the adoption of technology to monitor the calls of birds and bats and learn about the different species populated a local area. It provides easy-to-follow documentation to build and install the device as well as to visualise in real-time bats and birds calls. This project hopes to gain better understanding of how birds and bats species are distributed and adapted to various environment.

### Minimal Viable Project
Shazam4BB is a DIY birds and bats species audio classification device, which consists of both hardware (microphone, single-board computer) and software (classification algorithm and web server). To make it viable, a bats or birds species algorithm has to be implemented, an internet connection has to exist, and results have to be saved into a database. 

1. Process: Audio recording. Microphone. Single-board computer with Audio Input.
2. Analysis: Audio analysis. Deep-Learning Algorithm to identify species in spectrogram.
3. Visualisation: Audio results. Save result in database. 
4. Components: Microphone, Computer Processing Unit (CPU, GPU), Power module, Communication (Wifi, LoRa) Module

Shazam4BB is a on-going project. It has started with the help of the [**Open Hardware Makers (OHM)**](https://curriculum.openhardware.space/) and [**GOSH's 2022 Collaborative Development**](https://forum.openhardware.science/t/apply-here-for-gosh-s-2022-collaborative-development-program-round-1/3380)  programmes. The aim of this project is to improve the technical capability of the 4 years old ["Shazam for Bats"](https://connected-environments.org/portfolio/shazamforbats/) project by migrating from an Intel Edison board to a Raspberry Pi board.  

#### Team
The team behind this project is composed of PhD Students, Professors, and Practitioners in the field of ecology and engineering based at the [Connected Environments Lab](https://connected-environments.org/) at The Bartlett CASA, at the [People and Nature Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/gee/people-and-nature-lab/) at the Centre for Biodvierstiy and Environment Research CBER at UCL. 

#### Specific Goals
There are similar open-hardware projects outhere that monitor and classify birds or bats in real-time. The project is specific for the following reasons:
- Classify bats in real-time on a Raspberry Pi. 
- Document the device enclosure. 
- Optimise for long-range transmission and low-power consumption. 
- Allow classification of Birds and Bats on the same device.
